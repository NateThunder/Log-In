# 🔐 LOGIN System

## 🎯 About
This program prompts the user to register credentials:
- **Username**
- **Password**

It then prompts the user to enter the credentials they previously set. If the credentials match, the user is rewarded with access to their theoretical account.

## 🛠️ Features
- Users must first register a username and password.
- Upon login, users must correctly enter their credentials.
- **Security Mechanism:** If the user enters the wrong username or password **3 times**, the system locks them out.

🚀 Secure your access and avoid lockouts! 😊
